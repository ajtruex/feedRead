### What is this?

It's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread">Node package</a> that contains everything you need to read a feed. 

It builds on the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">feedParser package</a>. It's simpler to call, no need to master streams or iconv. 

It handles encoding using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv">iconv</a> package. 

You can also parse text, so you can deal with files that contain feed data, not just feeds accessible over the web. 

Because we use feedParser, we handle all the formats and variability that it handles. 

It's an entry-level feed parser that will be useful to people who haven't mastered all of JavaScript. 

### Why?

Sometimes you need to quickly read a feed and do something with it, and don't have time for a major project. This package is for those times. 

It also provides good sample code for more advanced feed reading projects.
