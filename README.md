### What is this?

It's a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/davefeedread">Node package</a> that contains everything you need to read a feed. 

It builds on the <a href="https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser">feedParser package</a>. It's simpler to call, no need to master <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream">streams</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv">iconv</a>. 

You can also parse a string, so you can deal with files that contain feed data, not just feeds accessible over the web. Or the feed text could come from a database. 

Because we use feedParser, we handle all the formats and variability that it handles. 

It's an entry-level feed parser that will be useful to people who haven't mastered all of JavaScript. 

### Why?

Sometimes you need to quickly read a feed and do something with it, and don't have time for a major project. This package is for those times. 

It also provides good sample code for more advanced feed reading projects. 

And as you may have heard <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/">RSS is coming back</a> in a big way, and it's spring, and time for a little cleaning. ;-)
